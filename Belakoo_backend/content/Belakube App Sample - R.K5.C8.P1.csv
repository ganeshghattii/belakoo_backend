,TEACH,"Model strategies for learning and using new vocabulary in context, such as using context clues, word roots, prefixes, and suffixes to infer meaning. Demonstrate how to incorporate new words into sentences and discuss their meanings."
APPLY,GUIDED PRACTICE,"Divide students into small groups and provide each group with a text or passage containing the new words.
