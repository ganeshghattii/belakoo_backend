AAAA,,Process
ACTIVATE,HOOK,Begin the lesson by presenting students with a mystery object and asking them to observe and describe its properties. Encourage them to use their senses to explore the object and make predictions about what it is made of and how it behaves.
,ASSESS,Engage students in a brief discussion about their observations and predictions. Ask probing questions to assess their prior knowledge about the properties of matter and spark curiosity about the upcoming experiments.
,INFORM,"Explain the properties of matter such as density, solubilty, and thermal conductivity and conduct experiments on the same.  "
ACQUIRE,ENGAGE,"Introduce the concept of matter and its properties, focusing on density, solubility, and thermal conductivity. Provide examples and real-life scenarios to illustrate each property and its significance in everyday life."
,TEACH,"Demonstrate simple experiments to investigate each property of matter:
- Density: Fill graduated cylinders with water and invite students to predict which objects will sink or float based on their densities. Have students test their predictions by dropping objects into the water and recording their observations.
- Solubility: Prepare containers of water and various substances with different solubilities. Guide students in predicting which substances will dissolve in water and which will not. Allow them to experiment by mixing the substances with water and observing the results.
- Thermal conductivity: Heat water to a specific temperature and invite students to predict which materials will conduct heat the most efficiently. Have students touch different materials to feel their temperatures and record their observations.

"
APPLY,GUIDED PRACTICE,"Divide the class into small groups and assign each group a specific property of matter to investigate further. Provide materials and guidance as needed, and encourage students to collaborate and share their findings with their peers."
,INDEPENDENT PRACTICE,Instruct students to conduct additional experiments at home or in the classroom to explore the properties of matter further. Provide them with guiding questions or prompts to encourage independent inquiry and exploration.
ASSESS,SHARE,"Allow each group to share their experiment results and observations with the class. Encourage students to discuss their findings, ask questions, and draw conclusions about the properties of matter based on their experiments."
,ASSESSMENT,"Assess students' understanding of the properties of matter based on their participation in experiments, ability to record accurate observations, and comprehension of key concepts. Use a rubric or checklist to evaluate their experimentation skills, critical thinking, and communication."
