AAAA,Guiding Principles,Process
ACTIVATE,HOOK,Begin the lesson by asking students if they know what time is and how we measure it. Use a large analog clock to demonstrate the concept of time and ask students to share what they notice about the clock.
,ASSESS,"Gauge students' prior knowledge by asking questions such as:

Can anyone tell me what time it is right now?
How many numbers are there on the clock?
What do you think the big hand and the little hand on the clock represent?"
,INFORM,Students will be able to read analog clocks to the hour and half-hour.
ACQUIRE,ENGAGE,Show a storybook featuring characters going about their day at different times. Stop at various points in the story to ask students what time it might be based on the events happening in the illustrations.
,TEACH," Introduce the terms ""hour"" and ""half-hour."" Use the analog clock to demonstrate how to read time to the hour and half-hour. Practice counting the numbers around the clock and identifying the positions of the hour and minute hands for different times."
APPLY,GUIDED PRACTICE,Divide students into small groups and provide each group with a worksheet containing analog clock faces showing different times. Guide them through the process of reading the time on each clock face to the hour and half-hour.
,INDEPENDENT PRACTICE,Distribute flashcards with different times represented on them. Have students work individually to read the time on each flashcard and write down their answers. Encourage them to use the skills they've learned during the lesson.
ASSESS,SHARE,Invite students to share their answers from the independent practice activity. Discuss any challenges they encountered and provide additional support or clarification as needed.
,ASSESSMENT,Circulate around the classroom during independent practice to observe students' ability to read time accurately. Use a checklist or anecdotal notes to assess each student's progress in meeting the learning objective.
