,TEACH,"Explain that resources are things we use to meet our needs and wants (e.g., money, time, materials).
Briefly discuss the concept of limited resources: we don't always have everything we want, so we need to make choices.
Show a short list of real-world problems in your community (e.g., littering in the park, limited recycling options). Briefly discuss the impact of these problems."
APPLY,GUIDED PRACTICE,"Divide students into groups (2-3 students) and assign each group a real-world problem from the list.
Discuss as a class what resources might be needed to solve these problems (e.g., time, materials, creativity)."
,INDEPENDENT PRACTICE,"Groups brainstorm innovative solutions to their assigned problems. Encourage them to think creatively and consider the needs and wants of the community.
(Optional) Students can sketch their solutions on construction paper with markers/crayons."
ASSESS,SHARE,Each group presents their problem and proposed solution to the class.
,ASSESSMENT,"Discuss the importance of using resources wisely and coming up with creative solutions to real-world problems.
Briefly review the concepts of needs, wants, and resources."
